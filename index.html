      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        I am a life-long learner looking to expand my skills in front-end
        web development. I am currently a student at Code the Dream where I
        am practicing my skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Git. I have
        experience in the non-profit sector helping onboard volunteers to help
        at Girls Inc. by managing the Linktree website with up-to-date
        information. I also have experience in UX/UI Design and Research
        collaborating on projects where we developed proto-personas, research
        plans, affinity diagrams, storyboards, user flows, prototypes, conducted
        usability testing, and prioritized tasks with a 2x2 matrix. In my free
        time, I enjoy playing video games, hiking, and reading.
