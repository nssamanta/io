About

    I am an Intro to Programming Student at Code the Dream. I am expanding my technical skills by learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Git. I have experience in UX/UI Design and Research, working on projects where I developed and learned about user research plans, affinity diagrams, storytelling, mapping user flows, prototyping, conducting usability testing, and prioritizing tasks with a 2x2 matrix. My hobbies include hiking, video games, and reading.
